              hackathons. Additionally, the chatbot should cater to some of the
              following features: multilingual support, real-time updates,
              interactive FAQs, and resource recommendations. Also, there should
              be a differentiating factor for available platforms

            <h3>Real-Time Campus People Density Mapping System</h3>
            <p>
              The challenge is to develop a system that tracks and maps the
              movement of people across a university campus in real time using
              camera footage. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning,
              the system should detect, identify, and monitor individuals. It
              will visualise movement patterns on a campus-wide map or
              dashboard, track crowd density, and provide insights into space
              utilization. The system should also be capable of sending
              real-time alerts for unusual activities or security breaches and
              generating heatmaps and analytics for long-term trends.

            <p>
              Misinformation across media platforms undermines public trust and
              distorts reality. To address this issue, develop an AI-powered
              solution that can identify and verify misleading information in
              real-time. A tool that detects false content, cross-references it
              with credible sources, and automates the flagging of inaccuracies,
              ultimately promoting accurate information dissemination and
              safeguarding viewers from deception

              applications, such as creative writing, coding, music composition,
              and art creation. The platform should enable users to input
              context-specific parameters and receive suggestions to improve
              prompts based on factors like creativity, specificity, and
              clarity.

              step-by-step guidance through audio feedback or haptic sensors.
              The system will detect and avoid obstacles, providing timely
              alerts for safe navigation. Designed for both indoor and outdoor
              environments, the system should use appropriate positioning
              technologies to ensure accurate guidance. Users should have an
              option to customize their preferred feedback method, whether

              on-device analytics at the far edge without cloud dependency.
              Focus on real-time detection of abnormal conditions like health
              and safety violations, environmental hazards, or equipment
              anomalies across areas like agriculture, healthcare, and smart

              Develop an IoT solution to monitor pets in a home or outdoor
              environment, design sensor nodes to gather data on pets' movement
              and environmental conditions, and incorporate geospatial tracking
              and data analysis tools to support pet well-being and behaviour
              monitoring. It should track activity levels, providing insights
              into exercise and behaviour, while also monitoring environmental
              factors like temperature and humidity to ensure pets’ comfort.
              Health metrics such as heart rate and sleep patterns should be
              captured through compatible wearables, with data analyzed for
              behavioural trends and potential health issues.
